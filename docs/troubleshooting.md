# Troubleshooting

## React Inspector get stuck at "Connecting to Reactâ€¦" for RN ^0.43 ([#45](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/issues/45))

It usually on Android, the problem is related to `requestIdleCallback` API (try to check if it not work on debug mode).

This issue have been fixed in `react-devtools-core@^2.3.0`, please ensure the version is correct in your React Native project (Note that it's dependency of `react-native`).

Also, sometimes it have timer problem between host machine and device (emulator), you need make sure `date & time` setting is correct:

Or try to restart your device (emulator).
