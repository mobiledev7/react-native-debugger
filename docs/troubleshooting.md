# Troubleshooting

## React Inspector get stuck at "Connecting to Reactâ€¦" for RN ^0.43 ([#45](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/issues/45))

It usually on Android, the problem is related to `requestIdleCallback` API (try to check if it not work on debug mode).

This issue have been fixed in `react-devtools-core@^2.3.0`, please ensure the version is correct in your React Native project (Note that it's dependency of `react-native`).

Also, sometimes it have timer problem between host machine and device (emulator), you need make sure `date & time` setting is correct:

Or try to restart your device (emulator).

It may caused by [`xip.io`](http://xip.io) service (RN use it for debug on real device), it lead your machine IP doesn't resolved sometimes. It's [enabled by default](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ca9202f2385354b7a6b4d818ceb46bd96a037a7b/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh#L94), you can disable it in RN custom script on Xcode if you sure you don't need the service:
